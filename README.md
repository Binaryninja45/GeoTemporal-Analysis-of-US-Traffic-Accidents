# GeoTemporal-Analysis-of-US-Traffic-Accidents
Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of GitHub where I've been playing detective with a massive pile of US traffic accident data. Imagine a million little stories, each telling a tale of a traffic mishap, and here I am, sifting through them to find patterns, trends, and maybe a few surprises along the way. It's not just numbers and charts; it's about understanding when and where US roads get a bit tricky.
# Crunching Numbers: 
Got my hands dirty with Python and EDA to make sense of over a million records. It's like finding needles in a haystack, but way more fun.
# Time Travel: 
Dug into when these accidents happen. Spoiler alert: Rush hours aren't just bad for your mood; they're peak times for mishaps too.
# Map Quest: 
Played around with Folium to put these accidents on the map—literally. It’s like a treasure map, but for traffic accidents.
# Connecting the Dots: 
Turned data into stories through graphs and stats. Ever wonder if more accidents happen on sunny days or rainy ones? 

# Technologies Used
* Python: For data processing and analysis.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
* Seaborn & Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.
* Folium: For interactive geospatial mapping.
